# Solution

To solve the problem of finding the longest sequence of increasing temperatures in Haskell, we will follow a structured approach using the tools and techniques outlined in the task description.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step solution:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Import Necessary Modules:**
   Begin by importing the required Haskell modules for handling arrays.

2. **Read Input Data:**
   Read the temperatures input data. For the sake of simplicity, we assume it's provided as a list of integers.

3. **Create an Array from the Input List:**
   Convert the list of temperatures into an array for easier indexing.

4. **Implement Logic to Track Sequences:**
   Iterate through the array to identify sequences of increasing temperatures and keep track of the longest sequence.

### Complete Code

Here's the complete Haskell program to perform the task:

```haskell
import Data.Array
import Control.Monad (forM_)

-- Function to find the longest increasing temperature sequence
findLongestIncreasingSequence :: [Int] -> (Int, Int)
findLongestIncreasingSequence temperatures =
  let n = length temperatures
      temperatureArray = listArray (0, n - 1) temperatures
      -- Helper function to track the longest sequence
      go maxLen maxPos currLen currPos i
        | i >= n = if currLen > maxLen then (currLen, currPos) else (maxLen, maxPos)
        | temperatureArray ! i > temperatureArray ! (i - 1) = 
            go maxLen maxPos (currLen + 1) currPos (i + 1)
        | otherwise = 
            let (newMaxLen, newMaxPos) = if currLen > maxLen then (currLen, currPos) else (maxLen, maxPos)
            in go newMaxLen newMaxPos 1 i (i + 1)
  in if n == 0 then (0, 0) else go 1 0 1 0 1

main :: IO ()
main = do
  -- Sample input data, this could be replaced with actual input reading logic
  let temperatures = [30, 31, 32, 29, 30, 35, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 30, 31]
  let (longestSeqLen, startPos) = findLongestIncreasingSequence temperatures
  putStrLn $ "Longest sequence of increasing temperatures is of length " ++ show longestSeqLen
  putStrLn $ "Starting at position " ++ show startPos
```

### Explanation

1. **Data Import:**
   ```haskell
   import Data.Array
   import Control.Monad (forM_)
   ```
   We import `Data.Array` for array manipulations and `Control.Monad` for the iteration.

2. **Function Definition:**
   ```haskell
   findLongestIncreasingSequence :: [Int] -> (Int, Int)
   ```
   This function computes the longest sequence of increasing temperatures.

3. **Array Creation:**
   ```haskell
   let n = length temperatures
       temperatureArray = listArray (0, n - 1) temperatures
   ```
   This converts the list of temperatures into an array for indexed access.

4. **Tracking Logic:**
   ```haskell
   go maxLen maxPos currLen currPos i
     | i >= n = if currLen > maxLen then (currLen, currPos) else (maxLen, maxPos)
     | temperatureArray ! i > temperatureArray ! (i - 1) = 
         go maxLen maxPos (currLen + 1) currPos (i + 1)
     | otherwise = 
         let (newMaxLen, newMaxPos) = if currLen > maxLen then (currLen, currPos) else (maxLen, maxPos)
         in go newMaxLen newMaxPos 1 i (i + 1)
   ```
   This helper function `go` iteratively compares each day's temperature to the previous day's, tracks the length of increasing sequences, and updates the longest sequence's length and starting position.

5. **Main Function:**
   ```haskell
   main :: IO ()
   main = do
     let temperatures = [30, 31, 32, 29, 30, 35, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 30, 31]
     let (longestSeqLen, startPos) = findLongestIncreasingSequence temperatures
     putStrLn $ "Longest sequence of increasing temperatures is of length " ++ show longestSeqLen
     putStrLn $ "Starting at position " ++ show startPos
   ```
   The `main` function demonstrates the application of the sequence-finding function with sample temperature data. It prints out the results: the length of the longest increasing sequence and its start position.

This complete program effectively utilizes arrays and iterative logic to solve the problem of finding the longest sequence of increasing temperatures in Haskell.
